<body>In my youth football career I have playewd in multiple clubs. I played with my school team with great players and I have met Steven gerrard. I have trained with great coaches and they have taught me a lot.
    I support Arsenal and Galatasaray. They are both very good teams and they are both in the champions leauge. They are both top of the table in their leauges and I hope one of them in the champions leauge.
